OpenGL-FTGL version 0.01
========================

This module wraps some functions of the FTGL library.

FTGL is a free C/C++, open source library which makes possible to use
TrueType or OpenType fonts in an OpenGL application.

This module requires that both the FreeType 2 library
and the FTGL library have been installed.

* For the FreeType 2 library see:
    http://www.freetype.org/freetype2/
  
* For the FTGL library see:
    http://ftgl.sourceforge.net/docs/html/index.html 

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install
   
When building this module, the FreeType 2 and FTGL libraries will need
to be accessible. If those files are in a location where your compiler
does not find them by default, then instead of running 'perl Makefile.PL', 
you'll need to run:

perl Makefile.pl INC="-I/path/to/FreeType2_includes -I/path/to/FTGL_includes"
 LIBS="-L/path/to/FreeType2_lib -L/path/to/FTGL_lib -lftgl"

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires the Perl modules OpenGL and OpenGL::Image.
